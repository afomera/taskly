##  Taskly README

Taskly is just another to-do/task keeping application to help you keep focus.

* We're using the latest Rails 5 branch (5.0.0beta1) at the time of writing.
* Currently Ruby 2.2.3 though we will try to move to 2.3.0 for production


Also want:
* Recurring Tasks and To-Do Lists
* Dashboard of tasks / to-do Lists
* Ability to drag and drop into done sections like Trello would be nice.
* Try and implement SMS / Email notifications for upcoming tasks
